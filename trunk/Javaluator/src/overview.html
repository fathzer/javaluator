This
is a simple (but powerfull) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infix_notation">infix</a>
expression evaluator.<br>
<br>
Evaluating an expression is as simple as the following line :<br>
<code>Double result = new DoubleEvaluator().evaluate(expression);</code><br>
<br>
Key features:<br>
<ul>
<li><b>Expression syntax check</b>: Basic infix evaluators consider expressions
such as "4 3 +" as valid expressions. Javaluator performs a full syntax
check while evaluating the expression.</li>
<li><b>Functions support</b>:&nbsp;including variable number of arguments and functions with no argument.</li>
<li><b>Constants support</b>:&nbsp;for example pi and e when evaluating expressions on doubles.</li>
<li><b>Variables support</b>:&nbsp;Expressions can include variables (example "sin(x)").</li>
<li><b>Highly configurable</b>:
This library comes with a lot of built-in functions and operators, it
is very easy to reduce the number of them (for example, the sine
function can be removed from the function set if you want to implement
a financial calculator).</li>
<li>Localization: Function and constant's names can be changed easily.</li>
<li><b>Extensible</b>: This library is provided with some operators
and functions, if you need more, you can implement your own.</li>
<li><b>Small footprint</b>: This library is distributed as a 15kB jar.
It needs no external library in order to run.</li>
</ul>Limitations:<br><ul>
<li>Only one character long operators are supported.</li>
<li>Only unary and binary operators are supported (ternary operators such as <i>condition</i><b>?</b><i>value if true</i><b>:</b><i>value if false</i> are not).</li>
<li>Non-associative operators are not supported.</li>
<li>Only () parenthesis are supported (for now).</li></ul>
<br>
<br>This work is still under progress and some things may be changed in the
near future.<br>
