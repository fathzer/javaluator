This
is a simple (but powerful) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infix_notation">infix</a>
expression evaluator.<br>
<br>
Evaluating an expression is as simple as the following line :<br>
<code>Double result = new DoubleEvaluator().evaluate(expression);</code><br>
<br>
Key features:
<ul>
  <li><b>Functions support</b>:&nbsp;including variable number of arguments and 
    functions with no argument.</li>
  <li><b>Constants support</b>:&nbsp;for example pi and e when evaluating expressions 
    on doubles.</li>
  <li><b>Variables support</b>:&nbsp;Expressions can include variables (example 
    "sin(x)").</li>
  <li><b>Highly configurable</b>: This library comes with a lot of built-in functions 
    and operators, it is very easy to reduce the number of them (for example, 
    the sine function can be removed from the function set if you want to implement 
    a financial calculator).<br>
    It's also easy to define your own bracket pairs ({},[], etc ...) or to add 
    your own operators, functions or constants.</li>
  <li><b>Localization</b>: Function and constant's names can be changed easily.</li>
  <li><b>Extensible</b>: This library is provided with an evaluator that deals 
    with expression on real numbers, if you need one on complex numbers, or anything 
    else, you can implement your own.</li>
  <li><b>Full expression syntax check</b>: Basic infix evaluators consider expressions 
    such as "4 3 +" as valid expressions. Javaluator performs a full syntax check 
    while evaluating the expression.</li>
  <li><b>Small footprint</b>: This library is distributed as a 16kB jar. It needs 
    no external library in order to run.</li>
</ul>
<br>Limitations: 
<ul>
<li>Only one character long operators are supported.</li>
<li>Only unary and binary operators are supported (ternary operators such as <i>condition</i><b>?</b><i>value if true</i><b>:</b><i>value if false</i> are not).</li>
<li>Non-associative operators are not supported.</li>
</ul>
