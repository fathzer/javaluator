version	3.0.1 (19/09/2015)
fix
	DoubleEvaluator was not thread safe, even when each thread instantiate a new instance.

version	3.0.0 (27/05/2014)
improvement
	Because of the changes in AbstractEvaluator.tokenize method, <b>this version is not totally compatible with previous ones</b>. In particular, implementations that have overloaded AbstractEvaluator.tokenize method might not work.
	In order to have a clearer definition of the roles of the AbstractEvaluator.tokenize method, the following changes have been made, making now this method fully responsible for turning the evaluated expression into tokens:<ul><li>The tokens returned by AbstractEvaluator.tokenize method are no more trimmed by the evaluator.</li><li>The empty tokens returned by AbstractEvaluator.tokenize method are no more ignored by the evaluator.</li>
	The Tokenizer constructor is now public.
fix
	Fix "-" operator in BooleanSetEvaluator example. 

version	2.0.0 (01/11/2013)
improvement
	Change package name to com.fathzer.soft.javaluator in order to release the package to Maven central. Because of this change, this version is not compatible with previous ones.
	
version	1.2.4 (20/07/2013)
fix
	Fixes java.util.regex.PatternSyntaxException while evaluating an expression with an evaluator that accepts, for instance, only "or" and "and" operators.

version	1.2.3 (02/02/2013)
fix
	Evaluate an expression that starts a function argument separator caused a NullPointerException.

	The DoubleEvaluator considered numbers followed by "d" or "f" as valid ones.

version	1.2.1 (22/11/2012)
improvement
	Adds getDefaultParameters(Style) method to DoubleEvaluator. When passing Style.EXCEL_LIKE, to the DoubleEvaluator constructor, -2^2 is interpreted as 4, like in Excel or Bash scripts.
fix
	Revert the precedence of unary minus and exponentiation operators in DoubleEvaluator to the standard one, where -2^2=-4.  

version	1.2.0 (20/11/2012)
improvement
	Adds protected method tokenize(String) in AbstractEvaluator.
fix
	Fixes precedence of unary minus and exponentiation operators in DoubleEvaluator. Previously it returned -4 when evaluating -2^2, where bash shell (for example) returns 4.

	Support for operators with length > 1 (example &&, ||, ==)
