version	3.0.2 (12/27/2017)
fix
	DoubleEvaluator failed to detect syntax error in expressions like <code>min((10,15),20)</code>.

version	3.0.1 (09/19/2015)
fix
	DoubleEvaluator was not thread safe, even when each thread instantiate a new instance.

version	3.0.0 (05/27/2014)
improvement
	Because of the changes in AbstractEvaluator.tokenize method, <b>this version is not totally compatible with previous ones</b>. In particular, implementations that have overloaded AbstractEvaluator.tokenize method might not work.
	In order to have a clearer definition of the roles of the AbstractEvaluator.tokenize method, the following changes have been made, making now this method fully responsible for turning the evaluated expression into tokens:<ul><li>The tokens returned by AbstractEvaluator.tokenize method are no more trimmed by the evaluator.</li><li>The empty tokens returned by AbstractEvaluator.tokenize method are no more ignored by the evaluator.</li>
	The Tokenizer constructor is now public.
fix
	Fix "-" operator in BooleanSetEvaluator example. 

version	2.0.0 (11/01/2013)
improvement

version	1.2.4 (07/20/2013)
fix
	Fixes java.util.regex.PatternSyntaxException while evaluating an expression with an evaluator that accepts, for instance, only "or" and "and" operators.

version	1.2.1 (11/22/2012)
improvement
	Adds getDefaultParameters(Style) method to DoubleEvaluator. When passing Style.EXCEL_LIKE, to the DoubleEvaluator constructor, -2^2 is interpreted as 4, like in Excel or Bash scripts.
fix
	Revert the precedence of unary minus and exponentiation operators in DoubleEvaluator to the standard one, where -2^2=-4.  

version	1.2.0 (11/20/2012)
improvement
	Adds protected method tokenize(String) in AbstractEvaluator.
fix
	Fixes precedence of unary minus and exponentiation operators in DoubleEvaluator. Previously it returned -4 when evaluating -2^2, where bash shell (for example) returns 4.
